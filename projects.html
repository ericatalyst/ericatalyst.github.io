Tasked with creating a recommendation system that could improve user experience and tackle some of the discrimination-related problems plaguing AirBnB, I was the team lead and back end developer for a hackathon-winning project. Over 48-hours, our four-person team created an AirBnB mockup with a Watson API driven recommendation algorithm.
Github code currently has full seed file; follow README.md instructions for Watson integration.
