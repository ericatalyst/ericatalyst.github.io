        <strong>What are Mashups?</strong> As a musical term, a mashup is a form of remixing
        that takes two or more songs and layers them together. Some mashups use the lyrics
        of one song over the beat from another. Some mashups take a large number of songs
        (such as the top 100 pop songs released within a year) and play them back to back.

          One well-known mashup album is by DJ Danger Mouse. It is called "The Grey Album"
          and it only uses music from The Beatles' "The White Album" and Jay-Z's "The Black
          Album."
