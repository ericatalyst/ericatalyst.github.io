    <h1>Enjoy Mashups!</h1>
    <h3>*Evolving Existing Music*</h3>
    <p><strong>What are Mashups?</strong> As a musical term, a mashup is a form of remixing
      that takes two or more songs and layers them together. Some mashups use the lyrics
      of one song over the beat from another. Some mashups take a large number of songs
      (such as the top 100 pop songs released in a year) and play them back to back. </p>
      <div>
        <p> A well-known mashup album is by DJ Danger Mouse. It is called "The Grey Album" and
          it only uses music from The Beatles' "The White Album" and Jay-Z's "The Black Album."</p>

    <p> The example mashup below is of Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonanta" and The Eagles'
      "Hotel California." Skip ahead to 1:50 for the music to begin.</p>
