<div class='title'>Are You There Internet? It's Me, Erica.</div>
<p>
I am inspired to do work that is impactful and constructive.<br>
I made a hard turn out of business and into web development because I enjoy creating and I want my daily efforts to result in a meaningful product that people can utilize.<br>
I am passionate about communication: speaking, writing, and listening to others.
<br><br>
I am currently seeking full-time work and skill-based volunteer opportunities -- and always eager to collaborate on a hackathon!
